# Tome

Tome is a library written to support relay scripts for KoLMafia written in Typescript with React.

Tome is split in to two parts: The client and the server. The client is a library to be imported in
those relay scripts, whereas the server is a script that runs directly in KoLMafia and exposes data
to the client library.
